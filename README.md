## Understanding Quantum Mechanics:
From analytical to numerical analysis

In this repository you will find the programs and code used for and mentioned in the work "Understanding Quantum Mechanics: From analytical to numerical analysis" by authors Miguel A. Ramírez-Garrido [^1] and Roger J. Hernández-Pinto [^2].

The codes contain the calculations of the wave function's squared value for the three cases explored in this work, as well as the codes for the density plots of these functions. You may read the paper attached for more information.
